# Reddit Pulse

Reddit Pulse is an analytics tool that visualizes high-engagement discussions from specific subreddits. It consists of a Python backend that fetches and analyzes data from Reddit, and a frontend web application that displays the insights in a modern, interactive dashboard.

## Features

- **Data Analysis**: Fetches top posts from selected subreddits (e.g., r/n8n, r/automation).
- **Engagement Scoring**: Calculates a custom engagement score based on upvotes and comments.
- **Visual Dashboard**: Displays posts in a clean, categorized interface with hover effects and animations.
- **Local Deployment**: Easy to run locally for development and testing.

## Prerequisites

- **Python 3.8+**
- **Node.js & npm** (optional, recommended for local server)

## Installation

1.  **Clone the repository:**
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/your-username/reddit-pulse.git
    cd reddit-pulse
    ```

2.  **Install Python dependencies:**
    ```bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```

## Usage

### 1. Fetch Data

Run the Python script to fetch the latest data from Reddit:

```bash
python execution/reddit_public_analyzer.py --subreddits n8n automation --output reddit_report.json
```

This will generate a `reddit_report.json` file in the root directory.

### 2. Run Web Application

To view the dashboard, you need to serve the `web_app` directory. While you can open `index.html` directly in some cases, a local server is recommended to avoid CORS issues with fetching the JSON data.

**Using `npx` (No installation required):**

```bash
npx serve .
```

Then open [http://localhost:3000/web_app/](http://localhost:3000/web_app/) in your browser.

## Project Structure

- `execution/`: Contains the Python scripts for data fetching and analysis.
- `web_app/`: Contains the HTML, CSS, and JS for the frontend.
- `reddit_report.json`: The data file generated by the Python script (ignored in git).
